 * 0       HIGH         Up    Down    Left    Right    B     C
 * 1       LOW          Up    Down    LOW     LOW      A     Start
 * 
 * 6-button pad:
 * State   Select(TH)   Up    Down    Left    Right    TL    TR
 * 0       HIGH         Up    Down    Left    Right    B     C

 * 7       LOW          -     -       -       -        A     Start
 * 
 * Notes:
 * 1. Select idles in HIGH state in official games
 *    Unlicensed stuff like Everdrive and chinese multicarts actually read pads incorrectly, leaving Select pulled down after reading.
 *    We need to consider every option.
 * 2. For 3-button mode, Select pulse length is 6-6.5 us;
 *    For 6-button mode, Select period (Tsel) is non-uniform and depends on the game.
 *      For Street Fighter 2, select cycle looks like this:
 *          Select is active high
 *          first select pluse (to LOW state) is 25 us
 *          second (HIGH) is 4.7-5 us
 *          third (LOW) is 8-9 us
 *          fourth (HIGH) is 4.7-5 us
 *          fifth (LOW) is 9-11 us
 *          sixth (HIGH) is 4.7-5 us
 *          seventh (LOW) is 25 us
 *      For Streets of Rage 3:  
 *          Select is active high
 *          first select pluse (to LOW state) is 10 us
 *          second (HIGH) is 6.2 us
 *          third (LOW) is 7.3 us
 *          fourth (HIGH) is 6.25 us
 *          fifth (LOW) is 7.3 us
 *          sixth (HIGH) is 6.25 us
 *          seventh (LOW) is 7 us
 * 3. 6-button Select cycle length is around 50-100 us (50 for Streets of Rage 3, 84 for Street Fighter 2)
 * 4. Pad internal reset (Tres) is 2 ms (according to SEGA specifications on 6-button pad)
 * 5. Some 3-button pad-only games pulse Select line multiple times in 2 ms interval, triggering 6-button pad to output more than two states.
 *    For example, Ms. Pac-Man pulses Select line thrice in 100 us interval. This behaviour is considered incorrect.
 *    We can skip these pulses by delaying for more than 100 us after the first level change.
 * 6. It takes ~200-600 ns for 6-button pad to update its output after Select level change
 * 7. Frame period is 16.67 ms for NTSC and 20 ms for PAL
 * 8. Since we don't really need to read all buttons of 6-button pad, we can pretend that it doesn't exist
